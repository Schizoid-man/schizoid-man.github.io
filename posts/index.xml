&lt;p>A home server is in my opinion the best thing that you can do with old computers and hardware that just sits there doing nothing in your home. It started with me first finding this old laptop with a broken screen and keyboard which I couldnt use any more. Im sure all of us have this piece of ancient hardware that runs Windows 10 at 70% cpu utilisation and hasnt seen the light of day since the pandemic. If the hardware works, then linux works, and if linux works then you can use it to stream movies and music from your server to all your devices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Embracing Open-Source at FOSS India with Mukti Community</title><link>https://schizoid-man.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 14:11:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://schizoid-man.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Attending FOSS India with the Mukti team was an inspiring experience and a reminder of the power and potential of open-source software. Representing MSRIT alongside my peers, I got the chance to dive into the world of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) and engage with a community that’s passionate about technology, innovation, and collaboration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>What is Open Source?&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open-source software is more than just code; it’s a movement built on transparency, collaboration, and shared growth. In my work with Mukti, MSRIT’s FOSS club, we constantly look for ways to make technology accessible and inclusive. This event offered the perfect opportunity to connect with others who share these values and learn about the latest trends and projects in open-source.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
